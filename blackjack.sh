# This script is a simple implementation of the game Blackjack.
# It allows players to play against the computer and keeps track of their scores.
# The script uses functions to handle different aspects of the game, such as dealing cards, calculating scores, and determining the winner.
# It also includes a main game loop that allows players to play multiple rounds until they choose to quit.
# The script also includes a help option that explains the rules of the game and how to play.
# The script also includes a win option that helps players input the game cards and end with the best winrate possible.
